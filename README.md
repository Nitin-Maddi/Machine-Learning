# Machine-Learning
This Repo consists of 3 different machine learning models which can be used to predict data <br />
# Perceptron_Learning.ipynb: 
A Feed Forward Neural Network used to classify various functions such as OR, XOR, and a circular function with the help of the sigmoid activation function <br />
# Forward Propogation-Real.ipynb:
A Forward and Backpropogating Neural Network, with multiple layer support that is used to classify handwritten digits found in the MNIST dataset <br />
# DecisionTreeLearning.ipynb: 
A Decision Tree utilizing the principle of entropy to create the optimal decision tree from the given input in any scenario.
